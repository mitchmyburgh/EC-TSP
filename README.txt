Mitch Myburgh (MYBMIT001)
Solution to dynamic TSP

Results:
Lowest: 3514
Average: 3938.77
Highest: 4380

Compared with Michael Kyeyune (KYYMIC001)

Results:
Lowest: 2760
Average: 2971.66
Highest: 3230

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was run and it was found that both datasets are consistent with a normal distribution:
  Mitch's Data:
    KS finds the data is consistent with a normal distribution: P= 0.97 where the normal distribution has mean= 3939. and sdev= 187.1
  Michael's Data:
    KS finds the data is consistent with a normal distribution: P= 0.42 where the normal distribution has mean= 2979. and sdev= 95.50

Since both results are consistent with a normal distribution, independent and the same size a 2 sample T-test was performed:
