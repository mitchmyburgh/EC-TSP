The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was run and it was found that both datasets are consistent with a normal distribution:
  Mitch's Data:
    KS finds the data is consistent with a normal distribution: P= 0.72 where the normal distribution has mean= 4039. and sdev= 166.8 
  Michael's Data:
    KS finds the data is consistent with a normal distribution: P= 0.64 where the normal distribution has mean= 3887. and sdev= 187.0

The KS test additionally found that:
	The maximum difference between the cumulative distributions, D, is: 0.4100 with a corresponding P of: 0.000


Since both results are consistent with a normal distribution (and therefore parametric), independent and the same size a 2 sample T-test was performed:

H0: mean_mitch - mean_michael = 0
H1: mean_mitch - mean_michael != 0

The p-value was calculated for a two tailed distribution for sets with unequals variance. The p-value calculated was: 0.0000000003235251092
which is signifigantly less than 0.05 so we can re
